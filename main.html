	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1> 

	<p>I want to be a Frontend developer because designing website
		let me use my creativity skills. Frontend developer wasn't my
		initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it.I learned more
		about the subject via online resources and began to teach myself basic
		concepts. Eventually, I earned a bachelor's degree in software development.
		I enjoyed the challenges that my education presented, and I'm very excited 
		to work as a professional frontend developer and use the versatile skills 
		that this career demands.
